# EchoVeritasAI
 EchoVeritasAI – Project Update (v0.5 BETA)
**Date:** July 17, 2025

## 🧠 What We Built
In the past 24 hours, we launched a major leap forward in building a real-time media framing and transparency engine.

---

## ✅ New Features Implemented

### 🔍 Article Summary System
- Accepts any mainstream news article URL
- Extracts readable content using HTML parsing
- Summarizes the article using an LLM
- Generates **bias scores** for both the **source** and **content**

### 📰 Framing Summary by Outlet
- Shows how **CNN**, **Fox News**, and **NPR** frame the same topic
- Includes **direct quotes**, **tone summary**, and **citations**
- Gracefully falls back to public APIs/snippets when full article is blocked (e.g. Fox News)

### 📊 Bias Score Legend
- Visual color-coded bias scores:
  - 🟢 0.0–0.2 = Neutral
  - 🟡 0.2–0.5 = Moderate bias
  - 🔴 0.5+ = Strong bias
- Bias chart added to help users interpret results

### 🎨 UI & Branding Improvements
- Rebranded from **Source Verifier** → **EchoVeritasAI**
- Integrated sleek dark UI with gold accent
- Smooth fade-in animations and gold loading spinner
- Results shown in collapsible cards for cleaner navigation

## 🛠 Coming Soon

### 🧠 Dynamic In-App Article Search
- Powered by **GNews API**
- Search for news by keyword or phrase
- Filter for:
  - 🇺🇸 U.S.-based outlets
  - 🌍 Global outlets reporting on U.S. topics
- “🔍 Analyze” buttons on each search result for instant processing

### 🐦 Trending on X (Twitter)
- Automatically pulls tweets about the article topic from:
  - Official outlet accounts (CNN, Fox, NPR, etc.)
  - @WhiteHouse, Trump press team
  - Verified journalists and viral commentators
- Adds real-time public discourse to article analysis

### 💨 Instant Feedback System
- **Phased loading UI** for modern attention spans:
  - Summary + bias score load first
  - Framing and Twitter trends follow asynchronously

---

## 🔒 Ethical Practices
- No scraping of restricted content (Fox blocks are honored)
- Fallback to headlines + Twitter for restricted sources
- Always cite original articles for transparency
- Public disclaimer:  
  > *This tool does not replace or reinterpret the news. We encourage users to read the full article and form their own conclusions.*

---

## 💡 Vision
EchoVeritasAI is becoming a **centralized, unbiased hub** for news:
- Compare how different outlets spin the same story
- Explore framing
- See what people are saying in real time
- All in one interface, powered by AI — and built by humans who care about the truth

---

## 🧪 Status
- 🔧 Tech Stack: React + Tailwind + Flask
- 🧠 LLM + GNews API integrated
- 🎯 Beta is live and functional
- 🗺️ Roadmap for global coverage + mobile UX in development
